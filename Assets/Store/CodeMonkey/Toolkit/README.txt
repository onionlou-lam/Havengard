   * Want to interact with a server/API? Use the WebRequests class!

   * This toolkit contains a collection of super useful Tools and Elements to help you save time and make awesome games!

   * All Tools have a linked Tutorial Video that explains how it works, if you want to learn, or you can just use them. 
   * There are Demo Scenes for every tool (and walkthrough video) with easy to understand code for how you use them, 
   * most tools you just drag and drop a prefab or call a function from a single line of code.
   *
   * My name is Code Monkey and I've been making games with Unity for over 10 years, I've got 8 successful games published on Steam. 
   * 7 years ago I started a YouTube channel sharing my knowledge and in that time I've made over 800 videos/tutorials.
