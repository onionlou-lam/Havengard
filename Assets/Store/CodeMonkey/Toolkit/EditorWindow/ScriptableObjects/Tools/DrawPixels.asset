  description: 'Click to draw on the pixel grid, select a color and brush size, then
    save it onto a file.

    This can be used to add modding to your game. Let the
    players draw their logo, or maybe draw a map, or draw anything.

    You can
    also use this for level design, being Pixel drawing means you have individual
    pixels that can represent whatever you want.'
